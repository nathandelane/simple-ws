# simple-ws
Simple web service written using Spark, Log4j, and Gson - pretty close to as simple as it gets, simple meaning pure Java, with the addition of an embedded server, Jetty.

I've omitted Guice going forward - I don't need it, and I may simplify further.

I've omitted Guava for now, as I don't really have a need for it.
